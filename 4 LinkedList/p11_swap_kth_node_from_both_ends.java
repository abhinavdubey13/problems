/**
 * leetcode id : 
 * 
 * Given a singly linked list, swap kth node from beginning with kth node from end. Swapping of data is not allowed, only pointers should be changed
 * ========
 * example 
 * ========
 * Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, K = 2
 * Output: 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5 
 * Explanation: The 2nd node from 1st is 2 and 
 * 2nd node from last is 4, so swap them
 * 
 * Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, K = 5
 * Output: 5 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1 
 * Explanation: The 5th node from 1st is 5 and 
 * 5th node from last is 1, so swap them.

/**
 *  
 * 
 * ============
 * approach : 1
 * ============
 * Approach: The idea is very simple 
 * 1. find the k th node from the start and 
 * 2. the kth node from last is (n-k+1)'th node from start. Swap both the nodes.
 * However there are some corner cases, which must be handled
 * 
 * 
 * 1. X and Y are same
 * 2. X and Y donâ€™t exist (k is more than number of nodes in linked list)
 * ==========
 * TC = O(n)
 * SC = O(n)
