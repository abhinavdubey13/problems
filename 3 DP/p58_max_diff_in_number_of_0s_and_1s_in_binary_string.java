 * leetcode id : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-difference-zeros-ones-binary-string-set-2-time/
 * 
 * Given a binary string of 0s and 1s. 
 * 
 * The task is to find the maximum difference between the number of 0s and number of 1s in any sub-string of the given binary string. 
 * 
 * That is maximize ( number of 0s â€“ number of 1s ) for any sub-string in the given binary string.
 * 
 * =========
 * example:
 * =========
 *
 * Input : S = "11000010001"
 * Output : 6
 * From index 2 to index 9, there are 7 0s and 1 1s, so number of 0s - number of 1s is 6
 * 
 * Input : S = "1111"
 * Output : -1
 *
 *

 * 
 * consider 
 * 1 as -1
 * and
 * 0 as +1
 * 
 * then apply kadane's algorithm
