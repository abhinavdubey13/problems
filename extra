  - Sql Query including all the keywords like where, having, count, group by etc.

- trees : 
    - nodes at dist k 
    - level order 
    - right view
    - AVL
    - LCA
    - Print all the paths in a binary tree whose sum is k, where a path may start and end at any node
    - invert binary tree
    - given pre and post order , form binary tree


- linked list
    - reverse ll , reverse in group of k
    - check loop
    - Number is represented in linked list such that each digit corresponds to a node in linked list. 
      Add 1 to it. 
      For example 1999 is represented as (1-> 9-> 9 -> 9) and adding 1 to it should change it to 
      (2->0->0->0)
