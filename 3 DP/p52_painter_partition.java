 * 
 * We have to paint n boards of length {A1, A2â€¦An}. 
 * 
 * There are k painters available and each takes 1 unit time to paint 1 unit of board. 
 * 
 * The problem is to find the minimum time to get this job done under the constraints that any painter will only paint continuous sections of boards, 
 * 
 * say board {2, 3, 4} or only board {1} or nothing but not board {2, 4, 5}.
 * 
 *  
 * ============
 * example : 1
 * ============
 * Input : k = 2, A = {10, 20, 30, 40} 
 * Output : 60.
 * Here we can divide first 3 boards for one painter and the last board for second painter
 *

/**
 *  
 * 
 * ============
 * approach : 
 * ============
 *
 * using DP , with base cases as
 * 0. if no paintings or no painters
 * 1. if number if paintings = 1
 * 2. if number of painters = 1
 * ==============
 * TC = O(n^2)
 * SC = O(n^2)
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * NOTE : 
 * if the array is sorted , we can use a binary search approach 
 * but DP approach works whether the array is sorted or not
